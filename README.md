SQL Query Analysis Project
This repository contains a series of SQL queries designed to extract, analyze, and optimize data from a sample database. The queries are structured to demonstrate essential SQL operations such as filtering, sorting, joining tables, using aggregate functions, creating views, and optimizing query performance with indexes. The project aims to help users understand how to work with SQL for data analysis and improve query performance.

Features
Basic Data Retrieval: Learn how to use SELECT statements to fetch data from tables.

Filtering Data: Use the WHERE clause to filter records based on specific conditions.

Sorting Data: Organize query results with ORDER BY for better readability.

Grouping Data: Group data using GROUP BY and apply aggregate functions such as SUM, AVG, and more.

Joining Tables: Combine data from multiple tables with INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN.

Subqueries: Write nested queries to retrieve data from another query.

Views: Create and use views for reusable analysis queries.

Query Optimization: Improve query performance with indexes on frequently queried columns.
